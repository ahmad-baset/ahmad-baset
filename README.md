Hi there, I'm [Ahmed Abdelbaset (@A7med3bdulbaset)](https://github.com/a7med3bdulbaset)

To make the long story short, I had to have this side account temporarily for some purpose. Until September 2023, I did not have a powerful device. Just a core-2DOE with 2GB ram, and HDD. Which was definitely not programmable on.

So I used to code on [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces). It was providing me limit core hours. (180 to core hrs a month, e.g. 90hrs on 2-cores machine or 45 hrs on 4-cores). Codespaces has been infinitely helpful to me but hours were not enough. Couple this with the fact that my financial condition at the time did not allow for purchasing extra hours. As a result I created this account to use after exhausting the maximum core hours limit on my main account. Thanks to programming (especially Next.js) I now have my own laptop and a monthly income. 

What I would like to say is that I do not push code publicly on this account. All my work is in the main account. Visit me there [@A7med3bdulbaset](https://github.com/a7med3bdulbaset)
